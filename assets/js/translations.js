        // FAQ - General
        "faq.g.q1": "What is a B1/B2 visa and who needs it in Morocco?",
        "faq.g.a1": "The B1/B2 visa is a U.S. nonimmigrant visa required for all Moroccan citizens traveling to the United States. The B1 is for business (conferences, meetings, negotiations) and the B2 is for tourism, family visits, or medical treatment. They are typically issued as a combined B1/B2 visa, valid for up to 10 years with stays of up to 6 months per visit.",
        "faq.g.q2": "Where is the U.S. visa interview held in Morocco?",
        "faq.g.a2": "All B1/B2 visa interviews for Moroccan applicants are conducted at the U.S. Consulate General in Casablanca. The consulate is located on Boulevard Moulay Youssef. You must schedule your appointment through the CGI Federal portal after completing your DS-160 and paying the visa fee.",
        "faq.g.q3": "How long does the entire visa process take from Morocco?",
        "faq.g.a3": "The DS-160 form takes 1-2 days to prepare, payment confirmation at the bank takes about 24 hours, and interview wait times at the Casablanca consulate vary from a few weeks to several months depending on the season. We recommend starting at least 3 months before your intended travel date, especially during peak periods (summer and holidays).",
        "faq.g.q4": "What services does TruePathVisa offer?",
        "faq.g.a4": "We offer end-to-end visa assistance for Moroccan applicants, covering every step from application to interview. Book a consultation to learn more about how we can help with your specific situation.",

        // FAQ - DS-160
        "faq.d.q1": "The DS-160 is in English. Can you help me fill it out?",
        "faq.d.a1": "Yes, we assist applicants with the DS-160 regardless of language. Contact us to get started.",
        "faq.d.q2": "What is the DS-160 form?",
        "faq.d.a2": "The DS-160 is the Online Nonimmigrant Visa Application form required by the U.S. Department of State. It must be completed in English and collects your personal, travel, and background information. The form must be submitted online before you can schedule your visa interview at the Casablanca consulate.",
        "faq.d.q3": "What documents do I need for the DS-160?",
        "faq.d.a3": "You will need your valid Moroccan passport, CIN (Carte d'Identit\u00e9 Nationale), employment details or attestation de travail, education history, a digital photo meeting U.S. visa requirements (5x5 cm, white background), and details of your U.S. point of contact or hotel reservation. If applicable, previous U.S. visa information and Schengen travel history are also helpful.",
        "faq.d.q4": "Which consulate should I select on the DS-160?",
        "faq.d.a4": "Moroccan applicants should select \u201cCasablanca, Morocco\u201d as their interview location on the DS-160 form. The U.S. Consulate General in Casablanca is the only location in Morocco that processes B1/B2 visa interviews.",
        "faq.d.q5": "Can I correct mistakes on my DS-160 after submission?",
        "faq.d.a5": "Once submitted, the DS-160 cannot be edited. You would need to fill out and submit an entirely new form. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to double-check every detail \u2014 including name spelling, address formatting, and employment information \u2014 before submission to avoid costly mistakes.",

        // FAQ - Payment
        "faq.p.q1": "How much is the visa fee and can I pay in Dirhams?",
        "faq.p.a1": "The B1/B2 visa application fee (MRV fee) is $185 USD, payable in Moroccan Dirhams (MAD) at the current exchange rate. The exact amount in Dirhams will be shown on your CGI payment slip. This fee is non-refundable regardless of the interview outcome.",
        "faq.p.q2": "Where can I pay the visa fee in Morocco?",
        "faq.p.a2": "The visa fee is paid at authorized bank branches across Morocco. You\u2019ll need to generate your CGI reference slip first, then visit a partner bank with your slip and passport to make the payment in cash or by card. Branches are available in major cities including Casablanca, Rabat, Marrakech, Fes, Tangier, and Agadir.",
        "faq.p.q3": "How long after payment can I book my interview?",
        "faq.p.a3": "After paying at the bank, you need to wait approximately 24 hours for the payment to be validated in the CGI Federal system. Once confirmed, you can log into the portal and schedule your interview appointment at the U.S. Consulate in Casablanca.",
        "faq.p.q4": "Is the visa fee refundable if my application is denied?",
        "faq.p.a4": "No, the MRV visa fee is non-refundable \u2014 this is a U.S. government policy. However, the payment receipt remains valid for one year from the date of payment. If your visa is denied or you miss your appointment, you can reschedule a new interview within that year without paying again.",

        // FAQ - Interview
        "faq.i.q1": "What happens at the Casablanca consulate on interview day?",
        "faq.i.a1": "Arrive at least 15 minutes before your appointment. You\u2019ll go through security screening, submit your fingerprints, and then wait for your turn with a consular officer. The interview itself lasts 3-5 minutes and is conducted in English or French. The officer will ask about your travel purpose, ties to Morocco, and financial situation.",
        "faq.i.q2": "What documents should Moroccan applicants bring to the interview?",
        "faq.i.a2": "Bring your valid passport, DS-160 confirmation page, interview appointment letter, and visa fee receipt. Key supporting documents include: recent bank statements (relev\u00e9s bancaires), attestation de travail or registre de commerce, property deeds or ADOUL certificates, family booklet (livret de famille), travel itinerary, and hotel reservations.",
        "faq.i.q3": "Can the interview be conducted in French or Arabic?",
        "faq.i.a3": "Yes, at the U.S. Consulate in Casablanca, many consular officers speak French and the interview can often be conducted in French. In some cases, Arabic interpretation may be available. However, we recommend being comfortable answering basic questions in either English or French.",
        "faq.i.q4": "I was denied a U.S. visa before (Section 214b). Can I reapply?",
        "faq.i.a4": "Yes, a 214(b) denial \u2014 the most common refusal reason in Morocco \u2014 does not permanently ban you. You can reapply at any time. However, you must demonstrate changed circumstances: a new job, stronger financial proof, property ownership, or family ties in Morocco.",
        "faq.i.q5": "How does the consultation work?",
        "faq.i.a5": "Book a slot on our consultation page, fill in your details, and our team will contact you to confirm. Available in French, Arabic, or English. No payment is required upfront.",
